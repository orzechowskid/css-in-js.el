;;; css-in-js.el --- A minor mode used for CSS-in-JS -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; A minor mode for webapps that use css-in-js libraries like styled-components or emotion.  Based on `scss-mode' and `mmm-mode'.  Enable it with `M-x css-in-js-mode [RET]'.
;; Alternately, add a mode hook for your preferred major mode to automatically enable this mode when opening files:
;;
;; (add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda () (css-in-js-mode t)))
;;
;; Indentation is controlled by the value of `css-indent-offset'.
